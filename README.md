# UCSanDiegoX: DSE230x: Big Data Analytics using Spark

### Instructor : Yoav Freund, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UC San Diego

## Learning objectives
This course has two main goals: 
* The first is introduction to using large scale data analysis frameworks (Spark, XGBoost and TensorFlow). This includes the underlying computer architecture and the programming abstractions. 
* The second is to combine methods from statistics and machine learning to perform large scale analysis, identify statistically significant pattern and visualize statistical summaries.

## Topics Covered
* Memory Hierarchy, latency vs. throughput.
* Spark Basics
* Dataframes and SQL
* PCA and weather analysis
* K-means and intrinsic dimensions
* Decision trees, boosting, and random forests
* Neural Networks and TensorFlow

## Opinion/Comments
This is an ongoing course. I will keep uploading my Assignments here as I go through the course.
